1. Summarize your understanding of `node_modules` and it's relationship with `package.json` (covered in the video for the lesson). 

Both node modules and package.json make sure you have the proper extensions installed. It is in case you want to work with someone. However, if someone does not have the files installed, it will prompt them to install the extensions.

2. What does the ${} syntax do inside backticks? Why is it useful?

The ${} replaces the name of the constant with the name inside of the parenthesis. That is useful because you can easily change the word later while not changing the code around it.

3. What happened when you saved your code in VS Code? (Did it auto-format? Did you see any errors?)

When I saved my code in VS Code, it did automatically format the code to be better formatted. However, I did not see any errors that I noticed.

4. How many commits did you make for this assignment? Why is it better to make multiple small commits instead of one large commit?

 I had made 3 commits, but the first one I made a mistake, misunderstanding the fact that I need to replace the entire work. It is about to be 4 with this commit coming up. It is better to make small commits because just like a video game, it is better if you save often just in case if someone powers off your system, you won't have to lose hours of progress.

5. When do we use `const` vs `let`? What about `var`?

I got to be honest, I looked up this question on Bing. Const allows the variable to not change, so in scenarios where you are not doing a math problem or a complex equation, it is better most of the time if you use Const instead of Let. Meanwhile, if you are using a dynamic value, it is better to use Let. As for Var, Var is global unlike Const and Let being set in the coding block. If you do not want to have the entire thing revolve around a value, it is mostly better to use Const or Let instead.
